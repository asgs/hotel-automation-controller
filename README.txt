Hello! This is a simple Maven Java project implementing the assignment on Hotel Automation Controller. A few assumptions I've made are below.

1. The Sensor inputs are not read continuously. It's being read every five seconds to prevent a higher load on the CPU. It's configurable though.

2. As mentioned in the assignment, only the Night slot is taken into account. However, the code can slightly be modified to take that into account as well, if need be.

3. All user inputs are followed by pressing the Return key.

4. Unit tests for Model classes, Main class are avoided (intentionally).

5. The final Jar can be generated by running the command 'mvn clean package'. To run the jar, the command 'java -jar hotel-automation-controller-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' can be run from the target directory.

6. No other external dependencies used to keep the application simple enough.


Please do pass detailed feedback after your review. Thanks for reading!
